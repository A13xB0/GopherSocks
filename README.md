This is a Go Net Stream wrapper, a component Iâ€™ve found myself recreating for various projects that involve transmitting raw data over TCP, UDP, or Websockets. This module not only manages the transmission of data, but also oversees sessions and individual connections. It offers a user-friendly interface, simplifying the process of managing basic comms.


*Disclaimer: This is a project for me not for you, some of my projects may only be for my own use and not make any sense for their existence... some projects may not have tests, some projects may be unreliable... but its fun to practice...*
